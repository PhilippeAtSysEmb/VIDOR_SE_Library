# VIDOR_SE_Library (MKR VIDOR 4000)

This library for the ARDUINO MKR VIDOR 4000 card allows you to use the card's HDMI port to display video and play sound.
It is possible to use several graphics modes with different resolutions and screen frequencies.

The sound output is generated by 2 SID 6581 implanted in VHDL in the FPGA. SID 6581 is well known to Commodore 64 owners.

An [Audio/Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSbFltEfQBs) is available.
